Reversi
========================================

>Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8×8 uncheckered board. There are sixty-four identical game pieces called disks (often spelled "discs"), which are light on one side and dark on the other. Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color.

About development the game
========================================

> I made this game when I was just 17 and even did not have my own computer. I used to stay at school after classes in computer classroom to develop Reversi, a game for MS DOC written in Turbo Pascal. I had read about the game in the magazine Science and Life. It is strategy board game for two players and is very popular in Japan. I developed two modes of the game — for two players and one player with AI. I still keep the source code of the game on my hard drive. During the first year at the university I developed a couple of games for Windows. At that time I absolutely realized I want to create my own applications.
